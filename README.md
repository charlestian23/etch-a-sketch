# Etch a Sketch

This project is a simple implementation of Etch A Sketch. It was inspired by the [Etch-A-Sketch assignment from the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Throughout my learning process, I referenced the Etch A Sketch implementations by [michalosman](https://github.com/michalosman/etch-a-sketch) and [bscottnz](https://github.com/bscottnz/esketch).

The fonts and icons used, which are licensed under the Apache-2.0 license, were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
